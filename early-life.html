      <p class="text-content">Benoit Mandelbrot was born in Warsaw in 1924. His first teacher was his uncle, who did not give him a standard education but instead taught him how to think logically. He and his family moved to Paris in 1936, where they lived with a mathematician, Szolem Mandelbrojt.</p>

      <p class="text-content">Mandelbrot attended a number of universities and collected several degree. He went to the Lycée Rollin in Paris; the Lycée du Parc, also in Paris; the École Polytechnique, where he was taught by Gaston Julia and Paul Lévy; the California Institute of Technology, from which he obtained a master's degree in aeronautics; and finally the University of Paris, where he earned his Mathematical Sciences PhD. While this is not necessarily his "early life," his education was of course important to his later endeavors.</p>
