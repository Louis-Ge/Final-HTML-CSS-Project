      <p class="text-content">Benoit Mandelbrot was born in Warsaw in 1924. He and his family escaped to Paris in 1936, where they lived with a mathematician, Szolem Mandelbrojt. Thankfully, he and his family narrowly avoided Nazi suspicion during his childhood.</p>

      <p class="text-content">Mandelbrot's education was hardly typical. His first teacher was his uncle, who taught him to think logically. While living with Mandelbrojt, he accumulated plenty of mathematical knowledge. He first attended the Lycée Rollin in Paris; then, the Lycée du Parc, also in Paris; the École Polytechnique, where he was taught by Gaston Julia and Paul Lévy; the California Institute of Technology, from which he obtained a master's degree in aeronautics; and finally the University of Paris, where he earned his Mathematical Sciences PhD.</p>
